# üì± Quick Mobile App Setup Guide

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Get Your App Running

### 1. üîß Fix the Build Issue & Install App

Run the troubleshooting script:
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/simpleApp
./troubleshoot.sh
```

This script will:
- Clean all Flutter caches
- Reset Gradle builds
- Check your device connection
- Build and install the app
- Verify backend/frontend status

### 2. üì± Connect Your Phone

**Enable Developer Options:**
1. Go to **Settings** > **About Phone**
2. Tap **Build Number** 7 times
3. Go back to **Settings** > **Developer Options**
4. Enable **USB Debugging**

**Connect via USB:**
1. Connect your phone with USB cable
2. When prompted, allow USB debugging
3. Keep your phone unlocked during installation

### 3. üöÄ Alternative: Use the Build Script

If the troubleshoot script doesn't work, try:
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/simpleApp
./build_mobile.sh
```

### 4. üåê Configure Network (Physical Device Only)

If you're using a **physical device** (not emulator):

1. Find your computer's IP address:
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

2. Update the app's API URL:
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/simpleApp/App
# Replace 192.168.1.XXX with your actual IP
sed -i '' 's/10.0.2.2/192.168.1.XXX/g' lib/main.dart
```

3. Rebuild the app:
```bash
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build apk --debug
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Verify Everything is Running

**Start Backend (Terminal 1):**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/simpleApp/Backend
npm run dev
```

**Start Frontend (Terminal 2):**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/simpleApp/frontend
npm run dev
```

**Check Services:**
- Backend: http://localhost:3000/health
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001

### 6. üì± Test the Mobile App

1. **Open** "Device Sync App" on your phone
2. **Grant permissions** when prompted
3. **Test connection** - should show "Connected to backend"
4. **Register device** - should succeed
5. **Check dashboard** at http://localhost:3001 to see your device

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Gradle task assembleDebug failed"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/simpleApp/App
flutter clean
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

### Issue: "No devices detected"
**Solutions:**
1. Enable USB Debugging on phone
2. Use a different USB cable
3. Try different USB port
4. Restart ADB: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

### Issue: "Connection failed" in app
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure backend is running on port 3000
2. For physical device, use your computer's IP instead of 10.0.2.2
3. Check firewall settings
4. Ensure phone and computer are on same WiFi network

### Issue: Build takes too long or hangs
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Kill any hanging processes
pkill -f gradle
pkill -f flutter

# Clear all caches
flutter clean
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/
rm -rf ~/.pub-cache/

# Try again
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

## üìã What the App Does

The simplified mobile app includes:

‚úÖ **Device Information Display**
- Shows device ID and system info
- Real-time connection status

‚úÖ **Permission Management**
- Requests contacts, phone, SMS, storage permissions
- Shows permission status

‚úÖ **Backend Communication**
- Tests connection to your backend server
- Registers device with the system

‚úÖ **Dashboard Integration**
- Once registered, device appears in web dashboard
- Admin can monitor device status

## üéØ Next Steps After Installation

1. **Grant all permissions** in the app
2. **Register your device** successfully
3. **Open the web dashboard** at http://localhost:3001
4. **See your device** in the devices list
5. **Monitor sync status** and statistics

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Flutter Doctor:**
```bash
flutter doctor -v
```

2. **View detailed logs:**
```bash
flutter run --verbose
```

3. **Check device logs:**
```bash
adb logcat | grep -i flutter
```

The simplified app should build and run without the complex dependencies that were causing the Gradle issue. Once it's working, we can add more features incrementally!
