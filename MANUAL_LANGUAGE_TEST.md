# üîç Manual Language Functionality Test

## Current Status
Based on the automated test, the language functionality is **NOT WORKING** on your device. Here's what we need to do:

## üö® Issues Identified
1. **Language switching not working** - Text doesn't change when selecting different languages
2. **Language persistence not working** - Selected language doesn't save
3. **Language settings not accessible** - No language settings in the app

## üîß Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Current App Version
```bash
# Check what version is installed
adb shell dumpsys package com.devicesync.app | grep versionName
```

### Step 2: Clear App Data Manually
1. Go to **Settings** on your device
2. Find **Apps** or **Application Manager**
3. Find **Dubai Discoveries** app
4. Tap **Storage**
5. Tap **Clear Data** and **Clear Cache**

### Step 3: Test Language Selection Screen
1. Launch the app
2. You should see the language selection screen
3. Check if the dropdown shows these options:
   - English
   - –ú–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª (Mongolian)
   - –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian)
   - ‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese)

### Step 4: Test Language Switching
1. Select **–ú–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª** (Mongolian) from the dropdown
2. **Expected**: Text should change to:
   - "–î—É–±–∞–π –Ω—ç—ç–ª—Ç–∏–π–Ω —Ç–∞–≤—Ç–∞–π –º–æ—Ä–∏–ª"
   - "–î—É–±–∞–π–Ω –∏–¥ —à–∏–¥–∏–π–Ω –∞—è–ª–ª—ã–Ω —Ç–∞–Ω—ã —ç—Ü—Å–∏–π–Ω –∑–∞–∞–≤–∞—Ä"
   - "–•—ç–ª—ç—ç —Å–æ–Ω–≥–æ–Ω–æ —É—É"
   - "“Æ—Ä–≥—ç–ª–∂–ª“Ø“Ø–ª—ç—Ö"

3. Select **–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π** (Russian) from the dropdown
   - **Expected**: Text should change to Russian

4. Select **‰∏≠Êñá** (Chinese) from the dropdown
   - **Expected**: Text should change to Chinese

## üêõ If Language Switching Still Doesn't Work

### Problem: The APK doesn't have updated language code
**Solution**: We need to build a new APK with the updated language functionality.

### Problem: LanguageManager not working
**Solution**: Check if the LanguageManager.kt file is properly implemented.

### Problem: String resources missing
**Solution**: Check if language-specific strings are defined.

## üì± What You Should See

### ‚úÖ Working Language Selection Screen
- Welcome title in English
- Language dropdown with 4 options
- Continue button
- Feature previews at bottom

### ‚úÖ Working Language Switching
When you select a language, the text should change immediately:
- Welcome title changes
- Subtitle changes  
- Language title changes
- Continue button text changes
- Feature titles change

### ‚úÖ Working Language Persistence
- Select a non-English language
- Click Continue
- Close app completely
- Relaunch app
- Should skip language selection and go to main app
- Main app should use selected language

## üîç Debug Information

### Check App Logs
```bash
# View real-time app logs
adb logcat | grep "com.devicesync.app"

# Filter for language-related logs
adb logcat | grep -i "language\|locale"
```

### Check App Data
```bash
# Check if language preference is saved
adb shell run-as com.devicesync.app cat shared_prefs/app_prefs.xml
```

### Force Language Selection Screen
```bash
# Force launch language selection
adb shell am start -n com.devicesync.app/.LanguageSelectionActivity
```

## üéØ Expected Test Results

| Test | Expected Result | Current Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Language Selection Screen | ‚úÖ Visible | ‚úÖ Working |
| English Language | ‚úÖ Display correctly | ‚ùå Not working |
| Mongolian Language | ‚úÖ Switch to Mongolian | ‚ùå Not working |

| Chinese Language | ‚úÖ Switch to Chinese | ‚ùå Not working |
| Language Persistence | ‚úÖ Save and restore | ‚ùå Not working |
| Language Settings | ‚úÖ Accessible in app | ‚ùå Not found |

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **If language switching works**: Great! Test persistence and settings
2. **If language switching doesn't work**: We need to build a new APK
3. **If app crashes**: Check logs for errors
4. **If nothing changes**: The language code isn't in the current APK

## üìû What to Report

Please tell me:
1. **Does the language selection screen appear?** (Yes/No)
2. **Does the dropdown show all 4 languages?** (Yes/No)
3. **Does text change when you select different languages?** (Yes/No)
4. **What happens when you click Continue?** (Describe)
5. **Does the app remember your language choice?** (Yes/No)

This will help me determine if we need to:
- Build a new APK with updated language code
- Fix the LanguageManager implementation
- Add missing string resources
- Debug specific issues
