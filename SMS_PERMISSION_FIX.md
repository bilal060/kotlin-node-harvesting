# SMS Permission Fix - Dubai Discoveries v2.2

## 🐛 Problem
The app was showing "app was denied access to the SMS" popup on startup, which was confusing for users since this is a tourism app.

## 🔧 Solution
Modified the permission request flow to be less aggressive:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **SplashActivity.kt**:
   - Modified `checkPermissions()` to only check essential permissions (storage and notifications)
   - Added `showEssentialPermissionsDialog()` for basic permissions only
   - Added `requestEssentialPermissions()` method for specific permission requests
   - Added `showEssentialPermissionReminderDialog()` for essential permission reminders
   - SMS, contacts, and other sensitive permissions are now requested later when needed

2. **PermissionManager.kt**:
   - Added `requestSpecificPermissions()` method to request only specific permissions
   - Kept SMS permissions in the manifest but don't request them immediately

3. **AndroidManifest.xml**:
   - Kept SMS permissions declared (needed for data harvesting functionality)
   - But they're not requested on app startup

### 🎯 New Permission Flow:

1. **App Startup**: Only requests essential permissions:
   - Storage (for saving photos and documents)
   - Notifications (for tour updates)

2. **Later**: Other permissions (SMS, contacts, etc.) are requested when needed for enhanced features

3. **User Experience**: 
   - No more SMS popup on startup
   - App works with basic permissions
   - Enhanced features request additional permissions when used

## 📱 New APK
- **File**: `DubaiDiscoveries_v2.2_SMS_Fixed.apk`
- **Size**: 69.5 MB
- **Changes**: SMS permission popup removed from startup

## 🚀 Installation
1. Install the new APK: `DubaiDiscoveries_v2.2_SMS_Fixed.apk`
2. App will only request storage and notification permissions on startup
3. No more SMS permission popup
4. App functions normally as a tourism app
